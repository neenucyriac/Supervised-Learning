3. Model Comparison (2 marks)
1. Compare the performance of the five classification algorithms.----
Generally, Random Forest tends to perform the best due to its ensemble nature.
Logistic Regression and SVM often perform well due to their underlying assumptions.
Decision Trees may struggle with overfitting, and k-NN might perform the worst because it can be sensitive to the local structure of the data.
   
3. Which algorithm performed the best and which one performed the worst? ----
Compared the performance, typically finding Random Forest to be the best performer and k-NN the least effective in many cases.
